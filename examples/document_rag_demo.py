# AI in Healthcare: A Comprehensive Study

## Abstract
This study examines the application of artificial intelligence in healthcare systems.
We analyzed 500 cases across 10 hospitals over 2 years.

## Methodology
We used machine learning algorithms including:
- Random Forest (accuracy: 94.2%)
- Neural Networks (accuracy: 96.1%)
- Support Vector Machines (accuracy: 91.8%)

## Key Findings
1. AI reduced diagnostic errors by 23%
2. Patient wait times decreased by 35%
3. Cost savings of $2.3 million annually

## Conclusions
AI implementation shows significant promise in healthcare settings.
Further research is needed for broader adoption.
